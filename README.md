# IWW-IntelliWebWrapper- [development phase]
an AI based web-mining library for web-content-extraction using machine learning algorithms.

some of the features can be exploited now, and they are available in the code, things such as:
  
  - DOM extractor, mapper, reducer and flattening functionality...
  - lists detector algorithm.
  - main content detector algorithm.
  - CETD algorithm.
  - DOM tags detector script (highlighting the chosen nodes).


P.S : still in 'development phase'
