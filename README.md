# IWW-IntelliWebWrapper- [development phase]

an AI based web-mining library for web-content-extraction using machine learning algorithms.

currently, the library offers many functionalities to be exploited & some interesting algos to look at:

  - DOM extractor, mapper, reducer and flattening functionality...
  - DoC, degree of coherence, a euclidean distance based similarity.
  - LD, Lists detector algorithm.
  - MCD, Main content detector algorithm.
  - MCD algorithms results integrator method.
  - CETD algorithm.
  - DOM tags detector script (highlighting the chosen nodes).

P.S : 
   - the documentation isn't available yet.
   - LD & MCD algorithms are to be released as a research article in the near future.
