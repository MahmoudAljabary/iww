# IWW-IntelliWebWrapper- [development phase]
an AI based web-mining library for web-content-extraction using machine learning algorithms.

currently, the library offers many functionalities to be exploited & some interesting algos to look at:
  
  - DOM extractor, mapper, reducer and flattening functionality...
  - LD, Lists detector algorithm.
  - MCD, Main content detector algorithm.
  - MCD algorithms results integrator method.
  - CETD algorithm.
  - DOM tags detector script (highlighting the chosen nodes).


P.S : still in 'development phase'
